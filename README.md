Hi,

In this .zip you have the project and executable (.war). It was compiled with Java 1.8 and I used Tomcat 8.5 for deploying it.

I'm guessing it's not going to be enought but I did what I could... My initial idea was trying to combine springboot and primefaces.

I tried to use springboot to connect with a database, but I wasn't able to do it... At first, I tried with Microsoft SQL Server... Later I tried with MySQL... I didn't connect in any of those cases.

Also, I didn't complete to much of the frontend either, only the beginning, because I was getting a nullpointer when I tried to retrieve the information after pressing "BUY".


Greetings and thank you very much.
